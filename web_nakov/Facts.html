	  <b><p>#1</p></b> <p>The oldest and therefore furthest known galaxy we have discovered is over 13.7 billion light years away. It's called z8_GND_5296. The light has taken so long to reach us that the star which collapsed to form the gas that Sun is made out of wasn't "born" yet. Galaxies this far away from help astronomers understand the very early universe and how it has evolved over time. Due to the expansion of space, the distant galaxy pictured here technically wouldn't be there anymore and would actually be “currently 13.1 Giga light-years away from us. or 4.0×109 pc."</p>
	  <b><p>#2</p></b> <p>White dwarf stars will eventually stop emitting light and become black dwarfs. There aren't any old enough in the universe for this to have happened yet and it's estimated that it could take about a quadrillion years.</p>
	  <b><p>#3</p></b> <p>Pope John Paul II once told Stephen Hawking to not study the beginning of the universe because it was the work of God.</p>
	  <b><p>#4</p></b> <p> Plasma is actually the most common phase of matter in the universe. Despite being rare on Earth. The Sun, the stars, and the most interstellar matter is plasma.</p>
	  <b><p>#5</p></b> <p>In 2008, a gamma-ray burst was observed. It was a violent cosmic explosion, 7.5 billion light-years away, which is halfway across the visible universe, which could have been seen with a naked eye from the surface of the Earth. Anyone who saw it was looking billions of years into the past with their eyes.</p>
	  <b><p>#6</p></b> <p>The light of galaxies greater than 14.7 billion light years away will never reach us because those parts of the universe are receding away from us faster than the light speed.</p>
	  <b><p>#7</p></b> <p>Graham’s number is a number so large that the observable universe is far too small to contain an ordinary digital representation of Graham’s number, assuming that each digit occupies one Planck volume (smallest meaningful measurement).</p>
	  <b><p>#8</p></b> <p>Galileo was placed under house arrest by The Holy Office until his death in 1642 for defending his views about the Earth not being the center of the universe. The Vatican formally acknowledged they were wrong and Galileo was right in 1992.</p>
	  <b><p>#9</p></b> <p>There is a large area of space that is devoid of any galaxies that have been theorized by cosmologist Laura Mersini-Houghton, to be the imprint of a parallel universe.</p>
	  <b><p>#10</p></b> <p>There is a “one-electron universe” hypothesis which proposes that there exists a single electron in the universe, that propagates through space and time in such a way that it appears in many places simultaneously.</p>
	  <b><p>#11</p></b> <p>According to Article VIII of the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, you can be arrested for a crime committed anywhere in the known universe.</p>
	  <b><p>#12</p></b> <p>If you could fold a piece of paper in half 103 times, it would be as thick as the observable universe.</p>
	  <b><p>#13</p></b> <p>Our current model of physics only works for 4% of the matter/energy in the universe.</p>
	  <b><p>#14</p></b> <p>Over time a white dwarf will cool into a black dwarf. Given the length of time it takes for this to happen (10s-100s of billion years) and because our Universe’ age (13.8 billion years old), none are expected to exist yet.</p>
	  <b><p>#15</p></b> <p>The common spiral depiction of the Milky Way Galaxy used in media is actually another galaxy: Messier 74. Because we dwell within the Milky Way Galaxy, it is not yet possible for us to take a picture of its spiral structure from the outside.</p>
	  <b><p>#16</p></b> <p>The largest galaxy in the observable universe is an elliptical galaxy, IC 1101. It has 100 trillion stars and is 6 million light years across. By comparison, the Milky Way has a mere 100 billion stars and is 120,000 light years across.</p>
	  <b><p>#17</p></b> <p>If you watched an object slip into a black hole, no matter how long you watched, you would never actually see the object enter it due to time dilation.</p>
	  <b><p>#18</p></b> <p>A region near a black hole is called a photon sphere where the gravitational pull is so strong that light photons orbit it, meaning if you were at that point and turned to the side, you could see the back of your own head.</p>
	  <b><p>#19</p></b> <p>The fastest spinning Neutron stars known to man, rotate at 716 complete rotations per second.</p>
	  <b><p>#20</p></b> <p>The largest known black hole (Holmberg 15A) has a diameter of 1 trillion km, more than 190 times the distance from the Sun to Pluto.</p>
	  <b><p>#21</p></b> <p>The Oh-My-God particle was an ultra-high-energy cosmic ray that was detected on 15 October 1991 by the University of Utah. It was traveling so absurdly fast that time dilation dictates that it would have experienced only 16 days of time since the beginning of the universe.</p>
	  <b><p>#22</p></b> <p>The coldest known natural place in the Universe is the Boomerang Nebula. At −272.15°C it is 1°C warmer than absolute zero, and 2°C colder than background radiation from the Big Bang.</p>
	  <b><p>#23</p></b> <p>The Pillars of Creation, a nebula 7,000 light years away, was destroyed by supernova 6,000 years ago. In a thousand years, we will see it destroyed as it takes 7,000 years for the light to reach Earth.</p>
	  <b><p>#24</p></b>  <p>The SN 1006 supernova was the brightest star event in recorded human history. It was widely seen on Earth beginning in the year 1006. Some historical sources state that it was bright enough to cast shadows.</p>
	  <b><p>#25</p></b> <p>A neutron star is so dense that if an object was dropped from one meter above the star’s surface, it would hit the surface at a speed of 7.2 million km per hour.</p>
	  <b><p>#26</p></b> <p>Not only are there rogue planets floating through space completely alone, not orbiting any stars, but it is possible that these pitch-black lonely planets can support life.</p>
	  <b><p>#27</p></b> <p>The sun is brighter than about 90% of the stars in the Milky Way Galaxy.</p>
	  <b><p>#28</p></b> <p>On May 20, 1964, two astronomers named Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson working at a New Jersey laboratory turned a giant microwave antenna toward what they thought would be a quiet part of the Milky Way. When they heard static, they thought they were hearing interference from pigeon poop on their antennae. They were actually hearing microwave background remains of the beginnings of the universe.</p>
	  <b><p>#29</p></b>  <p>According to the string theory, black holes have the potential to be shaped like rings, helices, or even like the planet Saturn, but no one actually knows their true shape.</p>
	  <b><p>#30</p></b> <p>Hubble has captured a set of galaxies that have such a strong gravitational pull that they warp time and light, an effect known as gravitational lensing and this specific set of galaxies creates the appearance of a smiley face.</p>
	  <b><p>#31</p></b> <p>Mira, a dying star zipping through our universe is shedding its matter, each bit of which may one day grow into a new, individual star of its own. NASA has called it “The Johnny Appleseed of The Universe.”</p>
	  <b><p>#32</p></b> <p>The edge of the observable universe is ~46 billion light years away despite the universe being only ~13.8 billion years old.</p>
	  <b><p>#33</p></b> <p>Ancient Egyptians believed that the universe was created due to an ejaculation and Egyptian Pharaohs were required to masturbate ceremonially into the Nile.</p>
	  <b><p>#34</p></b> <p>The average color of the universe is a beige-ish white and therefore the color is named "Cosmic Latte".</p>
	  <b><p>#35</p></b> <p>During one of Stephen Hawking’s lecture in Japan, he was asked not to mention the possible re-collapse of the universe, billions of years into the future, for fears of its effects on the stock exchange</p>
	  <b><p>#36</p></b> <p>Thanks to the experiments conducted in CERN, we now know that every atom in the Universe could be undone in an instant by a simple, unpredictable and an unstoppable event, i.e., a quantum tunnel causing a phase-shift in the Higgs field.</p>
	  <b><p>#37</p></b> <p>A 'Googolplex' is such a large number, that if you were to write a '1', followed by a '0' on every single hydrogen particle in the known universe, you would not even get close to writing out the full number.</p>
	  <b><p>#38</p></b> <p>Uranium-238 has a half-life of 4.468 billion years or about 1/3 the estimated age of the universe</p>
	  <b><p>#39</p></b> <p>Approximation of Pi to 39 decimals is accurate enough to calculate the volume of the known universe with a precision of one atom.</p>
	  <b><p>#40</p></b> <p>The loudest events in the universe are starquakes. The largest ever recorded was in 2004, the star Magnetar SGR 1806-20 adjusted itself with the force equal to 22.7 on the Richter scale. It happened 50,000 light years away from Earth, but if it would have been 10 light years away, it would have caused a mass extinction of all animal and plant species on Earth.</p>
	  <b><p>#41</p></b> <p>There are more variations in the game of chess than there are atoms in the known universe.</p>
	  <b><p>#420</p></b> <p>Bismuth has a half-life of more than a billion times the estimated age of the universe,that is a lot and I don't know how much time it took you to get this far,but now click <a href="surprise.html" class="facts">here</a> or go to the next number. :P</p>
	  <b><p>#43</p></b> <p>There is a theory proposed by many physicists that our universe may exist inside a black hole and that every black hole in our Universe may contain a totally new Universe.</p>
	  <b><p>#44</p></b> <p>It is theorized that there may hypothetical objects that behave just the opposite of a black hole called a white hole. They cannot be entered from the outside, but matter and light can escape. The Big Bang might have been a white hole itself, and big bangs possibly occur at the center of all black holes.</p>
	  <b><p>#45</p></b> <p>Theoretically, if astronauts traveled in a spaceship at a constant 1 g of acceleration, they could travel the entire universe in their own lifetime, while billions of years would have passed by on Earth.</p>
	  <b><p>#46</p></b> <p>Only about 0.0000000000000000000042% of the universe contains any matter. The universe is a pretty empty place.</p>
	  <b><p>#48</p></b> <p>Some scientists theorize that space and time started as one dimension each (basically a straight line). As it cooled, the universe warped into the 2nd-4th dimensions. Some think that the Universe will eventually be promoted again, to a five-dimensional state.</p>
	  <b><p>#49</p></b> <p>Even though the Big Bang happened 13.7 billion years ago, and no object can move faster than the speed of light, the diameter of the known universe is at least 46 billion light years. It is because the expansion of the universe itself can occur faster than the speed of light. Particles cannot travel faster than the speed of light since if a particle has mass then it takes an infinite amount of energy to pass the speed of light. Space-time has no such limitation.</p>
	  <b><p>#50</p></b> <p>The coldest temperature ever recorded in the known universe was in Massachusetts, MIT, where scientists attained temperatures 810 trillionths of a degree Fahrenheit above the absolute zero (-459.67°F).</p>
	  <b><p>#51</p></b> <p>The universe has existed for just .00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001377% of its expected lifetime</p>
	  <b><p>#52</p></b> <p>Before the Hubble Space Telescope was launched, scientists were convinced that the Universe was no longer expanding. Not only is the Universe still expanding, but it is doing so at the rate of 74 kilometers (48 miles) per second.</p>
	  <b><p>#53</p></b> <p>In approximately 1 Googol (10^100) years, there will be no life, stars, or even black holes left in the universe; only subatomic particles with no way to interact will remain in the ever expanding universe.</p>
	  <b><p>#54</p></b> <p>A popular homeopathic treatment for the flu is a 200C dilution of duck liver, marketed under the name Oscillococcinum. As there are only about 1080 atoms in the entire observable universe, a dilution of one molecule in the observable universe would be about 40C. Oscillococcinum would thus require 10320 more universes to simply have one molecule in the final substance.</p>
	  <b><p>#55</p></b> <p>The JWST telescope planned to be launched in 2018 is 100X more powerful than Hubble and will be able to see the edge of the observable universe.</p>
	  <b><p>#56</p></b> <p>Scientists believed that during the Inflationary Epoch, roughly 10-36 seconds after the Big Bang, the universe expanded by a factor of at least 1026 or 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, becoming the size of a grapefruit.</p>
	  <b><p>#57</p></b> <p>Light in itself isn't special. According to Einstein, the fastest speed reachable in the universe is 300 million meters/second. It just happens that light is the only thing we have detected that travels without limitations in a vacuum, which is why we associate the speed limit of the universe with it.</p>
	  <b><p>#58</p></b> <p>The Higgs boson is nicknamed 'the God particle' not because of its fundamental role in the universe, but because of Leon Lederman, a theoretical physicist who wrote a book about it in 1993, called it the 'Goddamn particle', as it was so difficult to observe.</p>
	  <b><p>#59</p></b> <p>The theory of an infinite universe was first proposed by a Greek philosopher named Archytas of Tarentum ~400 B.C., reasoning that even if he did reach the end of the universe he would still be able to extend his staff beyond the boundary.</p>
	  <b><p>#60</p></b> <p>In 1054 a supernova in the Constellation Taurus was observed that was bright enough to remain visible during daylight for perhaps as long as 23 days. The remnant of the supernova, which consists of debris ejected during the explosion, is now known as the Crab Nebula.</p>
	  <b><p>#61</p></b> <p>Our own galaxy, The Milky Way has other smaller galaxies known satellites galaxies that orbit around it.</p>
	  <b><p>#62</p></b> <p>These interstellar objects that are smaller than galaxies have been named dwarf galaxies that have several billion stars and there are even smaller objects called hobbit galaxies.</p>
	  <b><p>#63</p></b> <p>The Andromeda Galaxy is not the closest galaxy to ours, and in fact, there is one 100 times closer called Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy that is 42,000 light years far from the galactic center and it is a satellite dwarf of the Milky Way.</p>
	  <b><p>#64</p></b> <p>The Milky Way is currently in the middle of absorbing another smaller galaxy, the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy, one of our satellite galaxies.</p>
	  <b><p>#65</p></b> <p>The Milky Way, Andromeda, and all the nearby galaxies are being pulled into something that we can't see that is tens of thousands of times more massive than our galaxy, called The Great Attractor.</p>
	  <b><p>#66</p></b> <p>It is theorized that if or when the Andromeda and Milky Way Galaxies collide in 3-5 billion years, chances of even two stars colliding is negligible because of the huge distances between them.</p>
	  <b><p>#67</p></b> <p>When you're looking at the Sagittarius constellation you're actually looking into the center of our galaxy.</p>
	  <b><p>#68</p></b> <p>In 2013, South African and Swedish scientists discovered that dung beetles navigate using the Milky Way for orientation. They are the first animals proven to use our galaxy for navigation.</p>
	  <b><p>#69</p></b> <p>The visible size of the Andromeda galaxy is over 4 times that of our Moon when seen from Earth. It is far too faint to be casually observed by the sky gazers. To an unaided eye, it just appears as a small, faint, fuzzy patch , unlike th surprise you gonna get<a href="surprise.html" class="facts"> here </a>.</p>
	  <b><p>#70</p></b> <p>It takes the Earth (and the Sun) 226 million years to orbit around the Milky Way Galaxy. Which means Earth has made the orbit around our galaxy about 20 times since the planet is 4.5 billion years old.</p>
	  <b><p>#71</p></b> <p>Scientists have named a galaxy, "Death Star Galaxy" because it is shooting an energetic blast of energy from its supermassive black hole at its companion galaxy and thereby destroying it.</p>
	  <b><p>#72</p></b> <p>Half of all stars aren't in a galaxy</p>
	  <b><p>#73</p></b> <p>The lowest note in the observed universe is caused by the rumbling of a black hole in the Perseus galaxy 250 million light years from Earth. It is 57 octaves below middle C</p>
	  <b><p>#74</p></b> <p>There are about 24 galaxies in the observable universe for every single person alive on Earth (170 Billion galaxies/7 Billion humans)</p>
	  <b><p>#75</p></b> <p>The "North Star" is actually a handful of stars orbiting each other</p>
	  <b><p>#76</p></b> <p>The Earth and our solar system are currently traveling through in an area with only 5% of the average density of the Milky Way Galaxy. It was likely blasted clear by a supernova 300,000 years ago.</p>
	  <b><p>#77</p></b> <p>In 2011, scientists estimated that there are at least 50 billion planets in the Milky Way, of which at least 500 million are in the "habitable zone" of their star. As of January 2013, the number of estimated planets in the Milky Way has more than doubled.</p>
	  <b><p>#78</p></b> <p>Supernovae explode on an average once every 100 years in a galaxy. Assuming there are 170 billion galaxies in the universe, there are 53 supernovae exploding every single second.</p>
	  <b><p>#79</p></b> <p>The last time a star went supernova in our galaxy was in 1604, and we're overdue for another one.</p>
	  <b><p>#80</p></b> <p>Quasars emit more energy than thousands of times the entire output of our galaxy.</p>
	  <b><p>#81</p></b> <p>Light entering our eyes from the top half of the Andromeda Galaxy is approx. 250,000 years older than the bottom half.</p>
	  <b><p>#82</p></b> <p>Scientists have found a star, now known as S2 that is orbiting a supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy at speeds exceeding 11,000,000 mph.</p>
	  <b><p>#83</p></b> <p>NASA dubbed Galaxy NGC 4151 the "Eye of Sauron" for its striking similarity to Tolkien's character.</p>
	  <b><p>#84</p></b> <p>A dwarf galaxy named Segue 2 is the least massive galaxy in the known Universe, located 114,000 light-years away. The galaxy consists of just 1,000 or so stars with a bit of dark matter holding them together</p>
	  <b><p>#85</p></b> <p>In 1994, when the Northridge Earthquake knocked out the power in Los Angeles, people contacted authorities and observatories wondering what the strange bright lights (stars) in the sky were.</p>
	  <b><p>#86</p></b> <p>There are more trees on Earth than there are stars in the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
	  <b><p>#87</p></b> <p>A star discovered 75 light-years away is no warmer than a freshly brewed cup of coffee.</p>
	  <b><p>#88</p></b> <p>Some of the shooting stars we see are actually astronaut poop burning up in the atmosphere.</p>
	  <b><p>#89</p></b> <p>Quasar 3c273 is 4 trillion times brighter than the sun and 100 times brighter than the output of all the stars in the Milky Way. It’s so bright, that if it were 33 light years away, it would shine just as bright in the sky as the sun, which is only 8 light minutes away.</p>
	  <b><p>#90</p></b> <p>Astronomers detected building blocks of life in a planetary system some 455 light-years away</p>
	  <b><p>#91</p></b> <p>Our solar system is ‘unusual’ in that it only has one star, more than half of the stars in the sky are binary or triple.</p>
	  <b><p>#92</p></b> <p>A neutron star is so dense that if you dropped a gummy bear from one meter above, it would hit the surface in a nanosecond at around 7,000,000 KM/H with the force of 1,000 nuclear bombs.</p>
	  <b><p>#93</p></b> <p>Most "shooting stars" (meteoroids) that hit the Earth every day are the size of a pebble</p>
	  <b><p>#94</p></b> <p>There's an unknown object in the nearby galaxy m82 that started sending out radio waves. The emission doesn't look like anything seen before</p>
	  <b><p>#95</p></b> <p>If two galaxies were to collide, it's unlikely that anything in them would touch. Galaxies are teeming with billions of stars but they are also very, very large. This means these stars are spread out, very spread out. To give you an idea of how sparse they are, the average particle in the air is 500 times its own width from another particle. Our Sun is 29 million times its own width from the next nearest star. So when galaxies collide we certainly don’t see Hollywood style explosions; in fact, close up you probably wouldn’t notice much at all. The collisions are so tame that they are usually just referred to as ‘mergers’.</p>
	  <b><p>#96</p></b> <p>A student wanted to name the international system of units to make 10^27 (1 octillion) a "hella" matter. The Universe would be 1.4 hella meters. If it wouldn't be rejected, it would make the universe officially "hella big".</p>
	  <b><p>#97</p></b> <p>According to the Hawaiian creation myth, our universe comes from the wreckage of another, earlier universe and the only creatures that survived from that alien universe are octopuses</p>
	  <b><p>#98</p></b> <p>If the history of the universe was condensed into a year, the Milky Way would form on May 15, life on Earth would appear on September 21, and the dinosaurs would go extinct on December 30. Modern humans would evolve on December 31 at 11:52 PM and Columbus would discover America at 11:59:58 PM.</p>
	  <b><p>#99</p></b> <p>The largest object in the universe Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall (Her-CrB GW) is over 10 billion light years long and theoretically shouldn't even exist</p>
	  <b><p>#100</p></b> <p>In Hindu Cosmology the God Brahma is not immortal. Rather his lifespan is 311 trillion 40 billion (311,040,000,000,000) Earth years, during which he oversees the creation and annihilation of innumerable worlds and universes.</p>
